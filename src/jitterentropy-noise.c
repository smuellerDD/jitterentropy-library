/*
 * This is the xoshiro256** 1.0 PRNG, discussed here:
 * https://prng.di.unimi.it/
 * "xoshiro256++/xoshiro256** (XOR/shift/rotate) are our all-purpose generators
 * (not cryptographically secure generators, though, like all PRNGs in these pages).
 * They have excellent (sub-ns) speed, a state space (256 bits) that is large
 * enough for any parallel application, and they pass all tests we are aware of.
 * See the paper for a discussion of their differences."
 * Paper: http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf
 *
 * Any time you see a PRNG in a noise source, you should be concerned.
 *
 * This PRNG doesnâ€™t directly produce the raw noise, or fundamentally
 * change the behavior of the underlying noise source. It is used in three
 * places:
 * 1) It use used to select the memory address being updated. The timing of
 * the update is the source of  the raw sample. This helps make each
 * read/update independent of the prior ones by making the addresses
 * statistically independent of each other.
 * 2) It is used to establish the number of memory read / hash cycles to do
 * prior to the one that is used as a source of memory read timing. This is
 * intended to help provide independence between used adjacent timings.
 * 3) It is used as a source of data for the hash loop. This use is
 * essentially a nonce.
 * This data is not required to be difficult for an attacker to guess, an
 * the output of this hash loop is not expected to contain any entropy.
 * The timing of this hash loop is used as an additional noise source,
 * which may contribute to the security of the system, but which is
 * assessed as providing no additional entropy.
 *
 * In summary, the output of this PRNG is used because it has excellent
 * statistical properties, but is never relied on for entropy production,
 * nor does it directly dictate the behavior of the primary or
 * secondary noise sources.
